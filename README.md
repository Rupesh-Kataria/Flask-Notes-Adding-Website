# Flask Notes Adding Website

Developed a Flask website with user authentication using Flask-Login library, allowing users to add and delete notes securely. Implemented additional protection measures by utilizing generate_password_hash function for password hashing and encryption. Utilized the flash module to generate informative messages for the users, enhancing their experience on the website. Created a relational database using SQLite, establishing a link between the note and user tables through a foreign key (user_id), ensuring proper organization and retrieval of user and note information
